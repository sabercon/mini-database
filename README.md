# Mini Database

A mini database built by following [Build Your Own Database From Scratch in Go](https://build-your-own.org/database/).

## How it works

This codebase is still working in progress.
The current implementation is a simple key-value store with a B+ tree index.

Going forward, the below features will be added to make it a relational database:

- [ ] Rows and Columns
- [ ] Range Query
- [ ] Secondary Index
- [ ] Atomic Transactions
- [ ] Concurrent Readers and Writers
- [ ] Query Language

## Testing

```shell
$ ./gradlew test
```
